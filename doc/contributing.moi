\2 {Fix a typo in documentation} {}

This action is not that easy as it supposed to be.  We use \ref {http://github.com/enzet/Moire} {Moire} markup and converter to automatically generate documentation for GitHub, website, and \ref {http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/} {OpenStreetMap wiki}.  That's why editing Markdown files is not allowed.  To fix a typo, open corresponding Moire file in \m {doc} directory (e.g. \m {doc/readme.moi} for \m {README.md}), modify it, and run \m {python roentgen doc} script.
*/

\2 {Modify the code} {}

First of all, configure your workspace.

\list
    {Install formatter, linter and test system\: \m {pip install black flake8 pytest}.}
    /*
    {Run \m {git config --local core.hooksPath .githooks/} to enable Git hooks (formatter and linter will automatically run for every commit, pytest will run for every push action).}
    */

\3 {Code style} {code-style}

We use \ref {http://github.com/psf/black} {Black} code formatter with maximum 80 characters line lenght for all Python files within the project.  Reformat a file is as simple as \m {black -l 80 \formal {file name}}.

If you create new Python file, make sure you add \m {__author__ = "\formal {first name} \formal {second name}"} and \m {__email__ = "\formal {author e-mail}"} string variables.

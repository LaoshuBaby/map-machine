### Code style ###

We use [Black](http://github.com/psf/black) code formatter with maximum 80 characters line lenght for all Python files within the project. Reformat a file is as simple as `black -l 80 <file name>`.

If you create new Python file, make sure you add `__author__ = "<first name> <second name>"` and `__email__ = "<author e-mail>"` string variables.
